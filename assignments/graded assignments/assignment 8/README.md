## Contents

- [Problem 1](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment%208/p1.c) - Write a simple function to cycle(‘int’) values stored in three variables. If a =1, b =2, c=3then after cycle you get a=3, b=1, c=2.

- [Problem 2](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment%208/p2.c) - Write a recursive function to compute factorial of a given number.

- [Problem 3](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment%208/p3.c) - Write a function which takes in an empty array of size 30 and fills it with the first 30values of the function T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-3) for n > 2. Where T(0)=0, T(1)=1,T(2)=1. (a). The function should only populate, you should print the result in main() after thefunction call

- [Problem 4](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment%208/p4.c) - In main, accept a string of ‘n’ characters (taken as input from the user) and write afunction which takes as inputa. a pointer to the stringb. Reverses the list of characters in place (i.e same memory location)c. The function should only reverse, you should only print the result in main()

- [Problem 5](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment%208/p5.c) - In main, use an array to store the integers (taken as input from user) and write a functionwhich takes as inputa. the pointer to the first memory locationb. an integer pointer to store the sum (result-pointer)c. an integer pointer which contains the length of the array.` The function should access the array elements using the pointer, compute sum andpopulate the appropriate memory location with the result.

- [Problem 6](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment%208/p6.c) - For this assignment, you are to implement a simple transposition cipher. This cipherencrypts and decrypts a sequence of characters by dividing the sequence into blocks ofsize n, where n is specified by the encryption key. If the input text has a length that is nota multiple of n, the last block is padded with null characters ('\0'). In addition to n, the keyalso specifies two parameters a and b. For each block, the i-th output character, startingfrom 0 as usual, is set to the j-th input character, where(ai ) mod n.j = + bFor appropriate choices of a and b, this will reorder the characters in the block in a waythat can be reversed by choosing a corresponding decryption key (n, a, b).
