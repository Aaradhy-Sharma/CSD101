## Contents

- [Question Paper](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment%209/Assignment%209.pdf) - You can find a copy of the original question paper here.

- [Problem 1](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment%209/p1.c) - Complete the program adding the following instructions. Print the value of p, p+1 and p+2 Print the value of *(*(p+i)+j) where 0<= i < 3 and 0<=j <4 Do the above using a as the pointer.

- [Problem 2](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment%209/p2.c) - Write a program to implement the concept of array of pointers. Create an array ofpointers of length 5. Create another array of integers of size 5. Now assign eachelement of the array to each pointer. Update the values of the array using pointers byadding 5 to each array element. Print the updated value using both array and pointerexpressions.

- [Problem 3](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment%209/p3.c) - Write a program to create a 3-dimensional array arr[2][3][2] of integers. Print thevalues of the array using pointer arithmetic where arr is the pointer and also find the largest number from the array using a pointer.

- [Problem 4](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment%209/p4.c) - Create a 2-dimensional array arr[3][5]. Create a pointer to the array. Now sort(ascending order) the array row-wise. At the end print the sorted array using pointer arithmetic.

- [Problem 5](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment%209/p5.c) - Dynamically allocate memories to store a pair of square matrices where thedimension values [MxN and NxM both N,M <=3] and the matrix elements arereceived from the user. Perform multiplication of these matrices. Use malloc() fordynamic allocation of memory and the function free() for deallocation.

- [Problem 6](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment%209/p6.c) - Dynamically allocate memories to two square matrices A and B. Check if thefollowing holds true: (A.B)-1 = B-1.A-1 . Use malloc() for dynamic allocation ofmemory and the function free() for deallocation. For ease of implementation, you canconsider 2x2 matrices.

- [Problem 7](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment%209/p7.c) - Scrabble is a word game. Two or more players can play it. Players make words usingletter tiles available with them and those already on the board. Each word has a scorebased on the value of each letter and the squares covered by the word. In this problemyou have to write a program that reads a word and calculates the score of the wordusing the letter values. Use the following values for the letters.
