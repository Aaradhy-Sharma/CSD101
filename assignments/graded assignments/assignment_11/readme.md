## Contents

- [Question Paper](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment_10/Assignment_structure.pdf) - You can find a copy of the original question paper here.

- [Problem 1](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment_10/p1.c) - 
Create two different structures: point and triangle. Structure point contains 
2-real values to define a point on xy-plane and triangle contains three 
points. 
Write a program which takes three points as input and checks if the points 
forming a triangle or not. If yes, then compute the length of all sides of the 
triangle. [Note: A triangle is valid if sum of its two sides is greater than the 
third side.]


- [Problem 2](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment_10/p2.c) - 
Create a structure to specify data on students given below:
Roll number, Name, Department, Year of joining.
Assume that the data is collected for the years 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 
for four different departments, namely, Civil, Mechanical, Economics and 
Maths. Each department has total 10 enrollments year-wise

- [Problem 3](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment_10/p3.c) - 
A record contains name of a cricketer, her age, and number of test matches 
that she has played and the average runs that she has scored in each test 
match. Create an array of structures to hold records of 20 such cricketers 
and then write a program to read these records and arrange them in 
ascending order by average runs. Use any sorting algorithm of your choice

- [Problem 4](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment_10/p4.c) -
Create a structure to specify data of customers in a bank. The data to be 
stored is: Account number, Name, Balance in account. Assume maximum 
of 15 customers in the bank. 
(a) Write a function to print the Account number and name of each 
customer with balance below Rs. 100. 
(b) If a customer request for withdrawal or deposit, it is given in the form: 
Acct. no, amount, code (1 for deposit, 0 for withdrawal)

- [Problem 5](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment_10/p5.c) -
Write a program to create an array of pointers to string where the strings 
are entered through keyboard. Now sort the pointers to point to strings in 
alphabetical order. Use malloc() for dynamic allocation of memory and 
the function free() for deallocation.

- [Raw Codes](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/tree/master/assignments/graded%20assignments/assignment_10/raw%20codes) - This folder contains the raw codes for the problems. The raw codes are alternate approaches to the same problems, you may use these for your reference.
