- [Problem 1](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/ungraded%20assignments/assignment%20on%20files/p1.c) - 
Write a function to do find-and-replace in a file. The filename, source-string andreplacement string should all be passed as input from the user. Assume that the length ofsource and the replacement string are the same


- [Problem 2](https://github.com/Aaradhy-Sharma/CSD101/blob/master/assignments/ungraded%20assignments/assignment%20on%20files/p2.c) - 
Create a function which takes as arguments two files.The first is the source file and thesecond is called the stop-words file. You should remove all words listed in the stop-wordsfile from the source-file

Write a program to create a database of students having the following information for eachstudent: Roll_no, Name, Marks_in_sub1, Marks_in_sub2, ..., Marks_in_sub6, Total. Yourprogram should take input of 10 students with all their information except Total, which youhave to calculate and write.
